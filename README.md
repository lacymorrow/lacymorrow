## üöÄ About Me

üéì My name is Lacy Morrow and I'm a **Full-Stack Web Developer** with a passion for **UI/UX Design**. I have decades of experience building and scaling large-scale software applications with technologies such as **Javascript**, **Typescript**, and **Node.js**.

üë®‚Äçüíª I enjoy contributing to **Open Source Projects** and have been a contributor to **Material UI** and **Bootstrap**. I also maintain a collection of **open source projects:**

I am constantly learning new technologies to stay up to date with the latest trends and am constantly building or prototyping something new.

üé® In addition to web development, I'm also passionate about **design**. I have experience creating **brand identities**, **logos**, and **user interfaces**. I believe that good design is essential to creating great user experiences. I also build and pilot **drones for action media**.

üìö In my free time, I enjoy building electronic hardware and reading. One of my favorite books is **The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy** by _Douglas Adams_.

üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è When I'm not working or reading, I like to stay active by going to the gym and practicing **yoga**. I believe that staying physically fit helps me stay focused and motivated in my work.
