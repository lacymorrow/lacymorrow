## 🚀 About Me

🎓 My name is Cait Russell and I'm a **UI/UX Designer** with a passion for **Photography**. I have years of experience designing bold & stunning software applications with technologies such as **AdobXD**, **Figma**, and **Fresco**.

I am constantly learning new technologies to stay up to date with the latest trends and am constantly building or prototyping something new.

🎨 In addition to web and app interface development, I'm also passionate about **photography**, **videography**, and **design**. I have experience creating **brand identities**, **logos**, and **website interfaces**. I believe that accessible design is essential to creating great user experiences.

📚 In my free time, I enjoy hiking, drawing, and reading. One of my favorite books is **A Wrinkle in Time** by _Madeline L'Engle_.

🏋️‍♀️ When I'm not working or reading, I like to stay active by going to the gym and practicing **yoga**. I believe that staying physically fit helps me stay focused and motivated in my work.
