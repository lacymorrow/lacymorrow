üéì My name is Lacy Morrow and I'm a **Full-Stack Web Developer** with a passion for **UI/UX Design**. I have decades of experience building and scaling large-scale software applications with technologies such as **Javascript**, **Typescript**, and **Node.js**.

üë®‚Äçüíª I enjoy contributing to **Open Source Projects** and have been a contributor to many **Open-source** libraries such as **Electron**, **NW.js**, **NextUI**, and the **Nightwatch** testing library. I also maintain a collection of **personal open source projects:**

I am constantly learning new technologies to stay up to date with the latest trends and am constantly building or prototyping something new.


üé® In addition to web and app development, I'm also passionate about **videography** and **design**. I have experience creating **brand identities**, **logos**, and **user interfaces**. I believe that accessible design is essential to creating great user experiences. I also build and pilot **FPV drones for action media**.

üìö In my free time, I enjoy building electronic hardware and reading. I've helped create hardware devices such as the [hackpack](https://hackpack.cc/). One of my favorite books is **The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy** by _Douglas Adams_.

<!-- 
üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è When I'm not working or reading, I like to stay active by going to the gym and practicing **yoga**. I believe that staying physically fit helps me stay focused and motivated in my work.
