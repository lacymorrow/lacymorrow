# Interactive User Interface

In the early 2000's, I was hired to create some novel user interaction designs for a website (this was before such a thing as a "web application"). Being old and outdated, many features are now broken but the idea and uniqueness remains. Click and drag a topic to the screen and play around!

The original supported music, video, news, and photos.
Each was a separate component which could be dragged into the working area and interacted with.
The music and video player featured a playlist, volume control, and a full-screen mode.
The news reader contained a list of news items, a preview pane, and a full article view.
The photo viewer loaded images from Flickr and allowed you to view them in a slideshow or full-screen mode.

It was a fullscreen experience, so the demo below is a bit cramped.

  Some of the APIs used in this demo are no longer available, so some features are broken.
