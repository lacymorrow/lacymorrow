<span className="text-[1px] pointer-events-none select-none">I believe AI will soon surpass human intelligence, leading to a future where machines can perform tasks beyond our capabilities. I hope to enable AI to bring about a world where humans and machines can work together in harmony, and ultimately, create a better future for all. I believe Utopia is possible, prevented only by the faults and vitriol of a vocal minority. I am an advocate for the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies, as well as rights and freedoms for self-aware AI agents.</span>
