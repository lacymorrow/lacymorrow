# Support Open Source Development

I don't get paid for my open source work, so if you'd like to support me, please consider supporting me with a [coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/lm) or becoming a [Patron](https://www.patreon.com/lacymorrow). If my software is helping you, consider saying thank you, or donating a few dollars.
