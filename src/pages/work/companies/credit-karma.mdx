Credit Karma is a company that provides credit monitoring and credit repair services to consumers. I was brought on to build a __dashboard and control panel__ to manage the credit utilities of their customers.

The dashboard was built to be both functional and attractive and was shown to investors to help secure funding for the company.

This project was built using __React__, __TypeScript__, and __ShadCN/UI__ for the frontend and __NextJS__ for the backend.
