Credit Karma is a company that provides credit monitoring and credit repair services to consumers. I was brought on to build a __dashboard and control panel__ to manage the credit utilities of their customers.

    </Zoom>
</Center>

The dashboard was built to be both functional and attractive and was shown to investors to help secure funding for the company.

This project was built using __React__, __TypeScript__, and __ShadCN/UI__ for the frontend and __NextJS__ for the backend.
