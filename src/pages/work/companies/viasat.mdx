Viasat is a global communications company that delivers high-speed satellite broadband services and secure networking systems. I worked on their __in-flight entertainment (IFE) system__ that powers entertainment and connectivity for major airlines including American Airlines and Turkish Airlines.

The IFE platform was built using __React__, __TypeScript__, and __Redux__ to deliver a seamless entertainment experience to millions of passengers worldwide. I focused on developing responsive user interfaces that work across various screen sizes and device types found in aircraft cabins.
