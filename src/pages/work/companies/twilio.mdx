I oversaw the development, testing, and deployment of the Twilio.com website and subsites such as the Twilio blog, guidelines, legal, and SIGNAL website. I built comprehensive, accessible customer experiences that were used by millions of developers and businesses around the world.

I also helped create the Hackpack v4, which was a physical piece of hardware and software that was sent to Twilio's VIP attendees at their developer conference, [Twilio SIGNAL](https://signal.twilio.com) in 2018.

## ⚜️ [Paste Design System](https://paste.twilio.design)

I helped craft the [Paste Design System](https://paste.twilio.design) and its [React component library](https://paste.twilio.design/components) to be used across Twilio products and websites.

## 🎉 [SIGNAL Developer Conference](https://signal.twilio.com)

I created the [SIGNAL 2020](https://signal.twilio.com) website, which was a fully custom React app.
