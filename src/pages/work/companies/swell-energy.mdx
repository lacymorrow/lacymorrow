The application was meant to be functional first, but was also demoed to investors and clients, so the UI was designed to be clean and attractive.

The dashboard was built to help Swell Energy monitor their solar panels and batteries. It was designed to be a comprehensive tool that would allow them to see the status of their systems, the amount of energy being generated, and the amount of energy being stored. The dashboard was built to be easy to use and to provide Swell Energy with the information they needed to make informed decisions about their systems.

This application was build using React, TypeScript, and ShadCN/UI for the frontend and NextJS for the backend.
