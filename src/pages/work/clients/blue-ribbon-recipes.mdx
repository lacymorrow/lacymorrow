## About

> Redesigned WordPress website and added new features; Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP

Barb's Blue Ribbon Recipes is a website that was created for a client who wanted to share her recipes with the world. The website was originally created in 2012 using WordPress, but the client wanted a new design and some new features. I redesigned the website and added a few new features, including a recipe search and a recipe submission form.
