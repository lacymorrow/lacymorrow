## About
> Complete web identity, design, and development. Created web presence for a charity fundraiser; Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP

Charlie's Vision is a charity fundraiser that was started in 2011. I created the website and all of the branding for the event. The website was built on a LAMP stack and was my first experience with PHP. I also created a custom CMS for the site that allowed the client to update the site content without having to edit the HTML.

I also joined 5 others in a 2,200 mile hike across the Appalachian Trail to raise money for in honor of Charlie. We raised over $5,000 for the cause.
